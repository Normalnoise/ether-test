1. Compile the Solidity Contract

First, you need to compile your Solidity contract to obtain the ABI and the bytecode. This can be done using the Solidity compiler (solc) or a development framework like Truffle or Hardhat.

For example, using solc:

```bash
solc --abi --bin CPAccount.sol -o build
```

This command will create ABI and binary files for your CPAccount contract in the build directory.

3. Install abigen

abigen is a tool provided by Go Ethereum (geth) that generates Go bindings from a Solidity contract's ABI. Install geth (which includes abigen) if you haven't already:

```
go get -u github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum`
```

3. Generate Go Bindings

After installing abigen and compiling your contract, use the ABI and binary files to generate Go bindings:

```shell
abigen --abi=./ubi/CPAccount.abi  --pkg=cpaccount --out=CPAccount.go
```


This command specifies the ABI file, the binary file, the package name (cpaccount), and the output file (CPAccount.go).
4. Use the Generated Go Bindings

Now you can use the generated Go file in your Go project.  using Go. Be sure to handle errors and exceptions as needed in your actual implementation.
